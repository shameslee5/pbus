A [PBU in football](https://ideascue.com/what-is-a-pbu-in-football/) is a term that stands for pass break up. It's a statistic that refers to a play where a defensive player either knocks down or tips an attempted pass, resulting in an incomplete pass. All defensive players have the opportunity to record PBUs, though members of the secondary are likely to record the most.
